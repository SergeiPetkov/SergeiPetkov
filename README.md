I am looking for a job as a SysOps/DevOps Engineer in a development team. I understand modern software development concepts and am studying the DevOps methodology. In short, here's what I can do:
* Automate routine tasks in Bash, Python;
* Configure hosts in Ansible;
* Containerize applications in Python, PHP, JavaScript;
* Write pipelines for GitLab CI and Jenkins;
* Set up monitoring and logging using ELK/Prometheus/Grafana;
* Administer internal company resources (DB, VCS, Ops stuff).
